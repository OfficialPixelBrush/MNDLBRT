# MNDLBRTC
 Mandelbrot written in C for MS-DOS

The origin for all my later C Mandelbrot Ports. I haven't touched this code in 2 years, so it's definitely not representative of what I'm capable of now.
Consists of a few files:
## MNDLOLD
This was my first stab at this, and eventually grew too messy.

## MNDLBRT8
I believe this is the last Version I made. It has a few neat features, like BMP Exports.

## MNDLBRTL
This one has increased precision, as it uses long doubles, but it reduces its speed tremendously.

## MNDLBRTC
No idea

## MNDLBRTT
Idk
